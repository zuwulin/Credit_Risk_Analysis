# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The following analysis was performed in order to investigate which of the six working machine learning statistical algorithms is most suited to predict potential risky creditors based on the readily available past loans' information. The six models investigated in this analysis are, as follows: Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Cluster Centroid Undersampling, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifier (BRFC), and Easy Ensemble Classifier (EEC).

## Results
The results of a 6-model supervised machine learning analysis are presented below:
### Random oversampling

</p>

* For the oversampling, the balanced accuracy score was equal to approximately 65%.

* The precision rate was at 1% for high risk loan taker, while for low risk loan takers, it was a 100%.

* The recall rate, on the other hand, was 63% for the high risk loans, and 67% for low risk loans.
### SMOTE

* For the CC undersampling, the balanced accuracy score was equal to approximately 53%.

* The precision rate was at 1% for high risk loan taker, while for low risk loan takers, it was a 100%.

* The recall rate, on the other hand, was 57% for the high risk loans, and 48% for low risk loans.

* For the SMOTEENN, the balanced accuracy score was equal to approximately 65%.

* The precision rate was at 1% for high risk loan taker, while for low risk loan takers, it was a 100%.

* The recall rate, on the other hand, was 72% for the high risk loans, and 58% for low risk loans.
