# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The following analysis was performed in order to investigate which of the six working machine learning statistical algorithms is most suited to predict potential risky creditors based on the readily available past loans' information. The six models investigated in this analysis are, as follows: Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Cluster Centroid Undersampling, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifier (BRFC), and Easy Ensemble Classifier (EEC).
